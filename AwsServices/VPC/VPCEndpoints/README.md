# VPC ENDPOINTS

## AWS PrivateLink
AWS PrivateLink is a technology that enables private connectivity between your VPC and services (AWS services, third-party services, or services in other VPCs) using private IP addresses, without traversing the public internet. 

AWS PrivateLink is an `ENI` in your VPC  that act as the connection point to another service or customer account. 


## Prefix Lists 
AWS Managed Prefix Lists represent the dynamic IP ranges of AWS public services. They are used in route tables or security rules to allow traffic to those services without manually maintaining multiple CIDR blocks.
